\section{Conclusions}
In this study, a weather down time analysis for offshore wind farm installation  has been presented based on Discrete Event Simulation (DES).The weather conditions, distance matrix, vessel characteristics and installation strategy are simulated within the planing phase of an offshore wind farm and such simulation results can support the decision making process related to the transport and installation strategy. The Weather down time analysis presented in this study indicated that the lifting operation causes higher down time where the wind speed is the dominant factor.
