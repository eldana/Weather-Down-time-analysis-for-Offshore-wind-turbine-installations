\section{Conclusions}
In this study, a weather down time analysis for offshore wind farm installation  has been presented based on Discrete Event Simulation (DES).The weather conditions, distance matrix, vessel characteristics and installation strategy are simulated within the planing phase of an offshore wind farm and such simulation results can support the decision making process related to the transport and installation strategy. The results pointed out that the lifting operation where the wind speed is the dominant factor causes higher down time over other activities and improving the lifting operations could result in a significant reduction in the overall project completion time.
