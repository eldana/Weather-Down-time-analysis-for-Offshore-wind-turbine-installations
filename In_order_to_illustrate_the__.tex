In order to illustrate the simulation model developed, a case study has been performed and presented. The weather down analysis has been carried out for transport and installation of 72 turbines in the North sea considering the three different weather scenarios (Best, Average and worst). The project lead time is defined as the time elapsed from the start of the project until the completion of installing 72 turbines at the offshore site.
