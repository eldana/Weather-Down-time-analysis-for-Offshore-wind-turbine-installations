In order to illustrate the simulation model developed, a case study has been performed and presented. The weather down analysis has been carried out for transport and installation of 72 turbines in the North sea considering the three different weather scenarios (Best, Average and Worst). The project lead time is defined as the time elapsed from the start of the project until the completion of installing 72 turbines at the offshore site. The figure (Fig 4) presents the lead time for three different weather scenarios (Q20, Q50 and Q80) which are 223.64, 270.93 and 337.56 days respectively. The analysis indicated that the lead time has increased by 21.1\% and 50.9\% when Q20 is compared to Q50 and Q80 respectively. The lead time has also increased by 24.6\% when the weather scenario changes from average(Q50) to Worst(Q80) and this type of analysis helps the planner in providing an insight how the weather at sea highly affects the project lead time.
