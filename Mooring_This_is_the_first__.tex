Mooring:- This is the first activity where the vessel will be secured in order to load the turbine components and not weather dependent activity.
Loading:- The loading operation for each turbine component is dependent on the weather condition and it starts with tower loading, nacelles loading and finally blades. It has both working and down time due to the weather condition.
Unmooring:- One all the turbine components are loaded and the ship is ready to sail, the mooring system will be released and not weather dependent activity.
