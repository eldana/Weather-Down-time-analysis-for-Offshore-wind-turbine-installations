\section{Methodology}
The model has been developed using the Discrete Event Simulation and takes in to account the activities with in the transport and installation phase. In general the offshore wind farm comprises a number of phases like the pilling , foundation and turbine component transport and installation. Different phases require different types of resources and it could be carried out by different companies.In this paper the weather down time analysis is carried out for the turbine component transport and installations phase.In this section the development of the model and the input  parameters have be explained in detail.
