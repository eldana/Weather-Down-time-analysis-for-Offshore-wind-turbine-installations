It should be noted that the start date of the project is considered to be the first of March for all the analysis presented in this paper and 400 simulation runs have been considered for each start date of the project in order to quantify the weather down time along the logistic chains. An activity time has been allocated for each operation where 15\%  is incorporated as a safety factor representing any delay due to personal inefficiency or machine breakdown and non weather related loss. If the time required to complete a certain operation is 4 hours, 4 + 4*0,15= 4.6 hours has been considered in the analysis.
