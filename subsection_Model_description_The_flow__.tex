\subsection{Model description}
The flow chart below shows  how the activities are modeled along the logistics chain with the application of DES.  The number of lifts at the offshore site depends on the installation strategy and for this study the single blade installation strategy has been implemented.This installation strategy defined in such a way that all the turbine components will be transported to the offshore site without any pre-assembly operation and the parts will be installed one by one.
