The figure (fig 7) depicts the percentage of the time spent for different activities (Q80) under the categories of sailing, Lifting, Cycle related activities, Jacking and down time. Sailing and lifting combined represents 42.96\% of the entire project lead time and the weather down time represents 45.47\% of the lead time. looking at the causes of the down time, 69,03\% of weather down time is caused by the lifting operation in which the wind speed is the dominant factor. When we consider the down time percentage for the average case scenario(Q50), the down time (45.47\% of 270,93 days) has increased by 62,25\% compared to the best case scenario (Q20) which is 33,95\% of 223,64 days.
