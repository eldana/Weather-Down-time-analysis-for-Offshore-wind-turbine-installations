\begin{introduction}

The offshore wind energy has been progressing in the last 10 years. The annual offshore wind installation grows from 89.97 MW in 2004 to 1483.3 MW in 2014 (EWEA 2015). According to the European Wind Energy Association, 20 \% of the energy mix should come from renewable energy by 2020 (EWEA, 2007). Eventhough there exists a large amount of wind energy on European waters , it has several problems of huge cost of transport and installation facilities. It was discovered (Lange,Rinne & Haasis ,2012) that disturbances due to weather restrictions during the process of installing the turbine components at sea can lead to a significant increment of logistics costs. Green and Vasilakos (2011) noted that most of the costs associated with offshore wind energy development are still much higher compared to onshore counterparts.
