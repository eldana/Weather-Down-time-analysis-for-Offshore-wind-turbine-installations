\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Mooring}:- This is the first activity where the vessel will be secured in order to load the turbine components and not weather dependent activity.
\item \textbf{Loading}:- The loading operation for each turbine component is dependent on the weather condition and it starts with tower loading, then nacelles loading and finally blades. It has both working and down time due to the weather condition.
\item \textbf{Unmooring}:- Once all the turbine components are loaded and the ship is ready to sail, the mooring system will be released and not weather dependent activity.
\item \textbf{Transportation}:- There should good weather condition during the sailing time and the longer the distance the higher the weather down time. In order to avoid long duration of weather window down time  for the transport phase, It has been split into two phases where a transition point will be considered between the port and the offshore site.
\item \textbf{Position and set up} :- At the offshore site, the vessel should be first properly positioned so as to carry out the installation activities and  additional set up activities are also required. It is weather dependent and the wave height is the dominant weather restriction factor for this section.

\item \textbf{Installation} :-
