\section{Conclusions}
The development of offshore wind farms is very sensitive to any disturbances along the logistics chain that could stem from not having a proper plan in advance considering the weather time window. The efficiency of the wind farm installation can be improved by making use of the DES.
In this study, a weather down time analysis for offshore wind farm installation  has been presented based on Discrete Event Simulation (DES).The
