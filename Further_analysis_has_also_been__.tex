Further analysis has also been carried out in order to investigate the weather down time and its cause during the transport and installation operations. The figure (fig 5) depicts the percentage of the time spent for different activities under the categories  of  sailing, Lifting, Cycle related activities, Jacking and down time. Sailing and lifting combined represents 52,04\% of the entire project lead time and the weather down time represents 33.95\% of the lead time. looking at the causes of the down time, 75.52\% of weather down time is caused by the lifting operation in which the wind speed is the dominant factor.
