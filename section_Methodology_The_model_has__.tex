\section{Methodology}
The model has been developed using the Discrete Event Simulation and takes in to account the activities with in the transport and installation phase. There are mainly three assembly strategies currently used in the offshore wind industry:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Rotor Star (RS) -- Three blades and hub are pre-assembled to form a rotor in the staging area. Then, rotor is transported to offshore site.
\item Single Blade (SB) -- All the wind turbine parts are transported to the offshore site and installed one by one.
\item Bunny Ears (BE) -- Two blades are pre-assembled forming a bunny ears in the staging area. Then, the last blade is installed independently at the offshore site.
\end{enumerate}In general the offshore wind farm comprises a number of phases like the pilling , foundation and turbine component transport and installation. Different phases require different types of resources and it could be carried out by different companies.In this paper the weather down time analysis is carried out for the turbine component transport and installations phase.In this section the development of the model and the input  parameters have been explained in detail.
