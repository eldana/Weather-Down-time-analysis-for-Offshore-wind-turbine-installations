\subsection{Discrete Event Simulation(DES)}
 Discrete Event Simulation (DES) only takes points in time (events) in to consideration. Such events may for example, be an element entering a station or leaving it, or moving on to another machine. Any movement in between is of little interest for the simulation itself. What is important is that the entrance and the exit events are assessed correctly. When the element enters a material flow object, the software calculates the time until it exits that object.
