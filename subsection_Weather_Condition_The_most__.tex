\subsection{Weather Condition}

The most important input parameter for the offshore transport and installation activities is weather data at a specific site. The weather time series data has been obtained from meteorological station for the period of 1995-2008 for wind speed and wave height. Both historical weather data or probabilistic approach may be used so as to  analyze the project lead time of completing the installation of the Offshore wind turbines. Muhabie et al (xxxx) compared the installation f offshore wind farms based on discrete event simulation using both historical weather time series and probabilistic approach  and it was found out that both approach shows a good agreement.
