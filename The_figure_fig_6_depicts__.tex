The figure (fig 6) depicts the percentage of the time spent for different activities (Q80) under the categories of sailing, Lifting, Cycle related activities, Jacking and down time. Sailing and lifting combined represents 34,48\% of the entire project lead time and the weather down time represents 56,24\% of the lead time. looking at the causes of the down time, 69,93\% of weather down time is caused by the lifting operation in which the wind speed is the dominant factor. When we consider the down time percentage for the worst case scenario(Q80), the down time (56,24\% of 337,5 days) has increased by 1,5 folds compared to the best case scenario (Q20) which is 33,95\% of 223,64 days.
