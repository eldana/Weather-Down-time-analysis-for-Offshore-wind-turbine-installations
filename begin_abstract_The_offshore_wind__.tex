The offshore wind energy development has show a progress in the last ten years . Distance from the coast line and the depth of the water are getting increased from time to time.The transport and installation of offshore wind turbines is highly dependent on weather condition at sea. Any disturbance along the logistics chain could result in a significant delay in the project completion. However, a lot of research and development are still undergoing on how to develop a mechanism that could help install turbine components at higher weather restrictions (wind speed). The purpose of this paper is to carry out a weather down time analysis for offshore wind turbine transport and installations considering the weather restriction criteria for each activities along the logistics chain. A Discrete Event  Simulation (DES) model has been developed taking the vessel characteristics, distance matrix, installation methodology and sequence of activities into account . The results pointed out that the lifting operation causes higher down time over other activities and improving the lifting operations could result in a significant reduction in the overall project completion time. This paper also  gives an insight how a simulation weather down time analysis could  improve the decision support system in the offshore wind energy development industry at the planning phase.
